    Welcome to the Garelochhead Community Council web site.


    On these pages, we aim to offer easy access to the recent and current activities of the Community Council, as well as useful links to whatâ€™s happening in general in and around Garelochhead.


    You will find information for all our meetings and important dates.  We endeavour to include up to date information that we hope might benefit residents and visitors alike.


    Our web site is still new to us and all our contributors are volunteers, so please do get in touch to let us know what you would like to see on the site!


    Kind regards,
