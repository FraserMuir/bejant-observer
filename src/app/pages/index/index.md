    Welcome to the Garelochhead Community Council web site.


    On these pages, we aim to offer easy access to the recent and current activities of the Community Council, as well as useful links to whatâ€™s happening in general in and around Garelochhead. 


    You will find information for all our meetings and important dates.  We endeavour to include up to date information that we hope might benefit residents and visitors alike.


    Please also [click here](static/media/helpline-leaflet-gcc.docx) for details of our Community Council Helpline.
