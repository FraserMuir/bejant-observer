      We have received the following update from the Garelochhead Medical Centre regarding the status of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout:


      Medical Centre staff working extremely hard, and are running on schedule. The Medical Centre have now exhausted the list of all patients over the age of 50. There are some people who they have been unable to contact, but have continued to try and those that have been not contacted by phone, have been sent a letter in the post asking for the patient to contact the medical centre for an appointment and also to update their contact details for future.


      All residents over 80 who are able to come into the surgery for their second vaccination are now being contacted as well as housebound over 80s who will be vaccinated in the community by the District nurse team.


      Vaccine deliveries can be delayed, however fortunately this has only happened on one occasion and was resolved quickly.


      Any resident over the age of 50 who has not been contacted for a vaccination appointment should get in touch with the medical centre to update their details and to book their vaccination.


      If any patient feels like they should have been vaccinated already due to their occupation or are if they are an unpaid carer etc, please contact the medical centre, where the staff will be happy to help with information regarding this.
